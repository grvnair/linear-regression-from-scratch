# linear-regression-from-scratch
Created a Python program for Linear Regression algorithm from scratch.

Linear Regression Implementation from scratch using Python

Implemented a Linear Regression algorithm from scratch using Numpy library.
Calculated the alpha and beta values of the data points to get the best fit line.
Determined the R squared value to check the modelâ€™s performance.
Used visualization libraries, Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot scattered data points and the regression line.
Tested the algorithm against Salary Prediction dataset from Kaggle and achieved R squared value of 0.95.
